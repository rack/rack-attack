  # When this is invoked with a throttle with period 6 active, using
  # a random offset, we would expect about one in six to expire in the
  # first second. For the fixed start_time we're using, the offset_for
  # MD5 hash happens to come out to 15 expired, 85 throttled, out of 100.
  # (If anything about the algorithm changes, that count probably would
  # too.)
  #
  # When using an old-style period, the start_time is at the beginning of
  # the period, since 2020-01-01 00:00:00 == 1577836800 == 262972800*6,
  # and after 1 second we would expect 0 expires, thus 100 of 100 requests
  # to be throttled.
